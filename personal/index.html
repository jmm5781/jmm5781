            <p>
                I've navigated high-pressure Navy environments from the depths of the ocean to strategic international 
                operations, leading teams of 3 to over 100 people. My military career honed my skills in teamwork, attention 
                to detail and adaptability within a culture where lifelong learning is promoted and appreciated, setting a 
                solid foundation for my transition into software development. I bring a unique blend of strategic 
                decision-making, problem-solving, and a passion for technology, aiming to make impactful contributions in 
                the tech industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, as I embark on this new journey, I'm driven by the dynamic challenges and innovative potential of 
                software development. My goal is to merge my background in leadership and operations with my enthusiasm 
                for coding, creating solutions that leverage technology to improve lives. I'm excited about the opportunity 
                to grow within a team that values creativity, collaboration, and a mission-driven approach to technology.
