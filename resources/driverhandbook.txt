INTRODUCTION
The Oficial Florida Driver License Handbook is produced by the Florida Department
of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV). This guide has the information
you need to prepare for the Florida Driver License Class E Knowledge Exam, the
Driving Skills Test, and to help you drive safely and lawfully.
Disclaimer
The Oficial Florida Driver License Handbook contains condensed and paraphrased
points of Florida laws and provides safety advice not specifically addressed in the
laws. The handbook is not a legal authority and is not intended for use in court.
This handbook will not reflect any changes made by the Florida Legislature afer
the last revision date (located at the bottom of this page).
Warning
Florida law prohibits using a false name, making a false statement, concealing a
material fact or otherwise using fraud in an application for a driver license or ID
card. The penalty can be up to five years in prison, a $5,000 fine, and suspension
of any existing driving privilege for at least one year.
In addition, it is illegal to permit or authorize an unlicensed person to drive a motor
vehicle and doing so can result in a 60-day jail sentence and a $500 fine. If the vehicle
is involved in a crash resulting in bodily injury or death of any person, the person
who permitted the unlicensed person to drive may (unless this is an automatic
mandatory suspension) have his/her license suspended for one year.
Public Records
Florida law requires FLHSMV to collect certain personal information during the
licensing process. This information, which identifies licensed individuals, is used
for records management, driver improvement, financial responsibility, and law
enforcement purposes. If you do not provide the required information, you will
not receive a driver license or ID card.
Florida’s Public Records Law makes all records made or received by FLHSMV in the
course of its oficial business available for inspection, unless specifically exempted
by law. Your personal information, including name, address, and driver license
number is exempt from public disclosure, but may be given to law enforcement
agencies and other entities permitted by law to access the information. Your med
ical information, social security number, and emergency contact information are
available only as specifically authorized by law.
FLHSMV strives to ensure the accuracy of the information obtained during the
licensing process. If you discover any incorrect information, please call (850)
617-2000 or mail your request with your complete name, date of birth, driver
license number, information about the error, and any documentation to support
your request to: Chief of the Bureau of Records, 2900 Apalachee Parkway MS 89,
Tallahassee, FL 32399. Some information, such as reports of convictions received
from a court, can only be corrected if notification from the court is received that
the report was in error.

The Oficial Florida Driver License Handbook—rev. 06/2022 v
Hello, Florida drivers –
The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor
Vehicles (FLHSMV) is pleased to provide you with the
Oficial Florida Driver License Handbook, designed to
help you become a safe, courteous, and knowledgeable driver.
Becoming a licensed driver is an exciting time, bringing
new independence and opportunity—and most
importantly, a solemn responsibility. A solemn
responsibility to drive with care, courtesy, and
confidence every time you get behind the wheel to
ensure the safety of you and the millions of people
who travel Florida’s roadways.
Prior to 1939, any person, regardless of age, was free to operate a vehicle on Florida
highways so long as they observed a few basic rules of the road and did not drive
intoxicated. By 1941, new legislation required everyone applying for an original driver
license to pass a vision, road sign, road rules, and driving test. In 1946, the first
comprehensive driver license examination program was established, and the first
Florida Examiner’s Manual was published.
Florida’s trafic safety laws and driver education have come a long way, but the golden
rule of driving has always remained the same—drive as you want others around you
to drive.
Tragic and life-altering car crashes are unfortunately all too common, and ofen caused
by someone who chose to not follow the law. We see the heartbreak these crashes
cause to families, friends, and communities; but seldom do we hear of the many crashes
that are prevented by motorists who are courteous, sober, and focused on the road
and their surroundings. These are the drivers that keep us safe and the type of driver
all motorists should aspire to be.
As you prepare to join Florida’s next generation of licensed drivers in reviewing this
handbook, please remember that the information, skills, and behaviors you are learning
are more than just answers to a test. Being a safe driver is a lifelong devotion, and one
that must be reafirmed every time you get behind the wheel. Please do no overestimate your driving abilities and underestimate the risks—the danger is all too real.
Congratulations on this exciting new step in your life. I wish you success and safety in
your travels ahead.

Executive Director

Bumper Height
Requirements
Owners of automobiles and pickup
trucks are required to have front and
rear bumpers mounted within certain
height levels. Height limitations are
governed by the net shipping weight of
the vehicle, not the modified or altered

It is illegal to tamper with, remove, or
cause not to work, any pollution control
device on your vehicle. Tampering can
cause damage your vehicle, increased air
pollution, lower gas mileage, less vehicle
eficiency & breathing dificulties.
Keep Your Car in
Good Condition
Brakes: Check to see that the pedal
stays well above the floor when you
step on it. If the car pulls to one side
when you use the brakes or if you hear
any scraping or squealing noises, your
brakes may need to be repaired.
Lights: Check ofen, replace burnedout bulbs and keep lenses clean.
Tires: Inspect ofen for proper
inflation/tire pressure, even
tread wear and damage.
Windows and Windshields: Keep
the glass clean inside and out.
Rear Window: If the rear window is
covered by or treated with any material
that makes it non-transparent, the
vehicle must be equipped with side
mirrors on both sides that allow the
driver a rearview of at least 200 feet.
Read your vehicle owner’s manual!
It is an excellent resource for information specific to your vehicle,
such as: what types of fluids your
car requires, what dashboard warning lights mean, what your car services intervals are, and more.
..........................................................................PREPARING TO DRIVE: YOUR VEHICLE
Anti-Lock Brake System
Anti-lock brake system (ABS) prevents
skidding and allows drivers to steer
during an emergency braking situation.
ABS can help improve vehicle stability,
steering, and stopping capability.
It is important to know if your vehicle has ABS because it will afect the
way you should stop in an emergency
situation. Drivers with ABS need to
press down hard on the brake pedal,
hold it, and steer out of danger. In an
emergency situation, the ABS automatically pumps the brakes at a faster
rate than the driver could. Removing
steady pressure from the brake pedal
or pumping the brakes will disengage
or “turn of” the ABS. Drivers with
conventional brakes must pump the
brakes in order to stop in an emergency situation where traction is lost
and the vehicle slides.
You can determine if the vehicle has
ABS by looking for a lighted ABS symbol
on the dashboard right afer starting
the engine, checking the owner’s manual, or asking the dealer.
Trailers, Towing, & Load
Equipment requirements:
► Trailer, semitrailer or pole trailer
weighing 3,000 pounds or less:
► REAR—two reflectors, one at
each side.*
► A brake light if the trailer or
load blocks/hides the brake
lights on the towing vehicle.
► Trailer or semitrailer weighing
more than 3,000 pounds:
► FRONT—two clearance lamps,
one at each side.
► EACH SIDE—two side marker
lamps, one at or near the front
and one at or near the rear.
Two reflectors, one at or near
the front and one at or near
the rear.
► REAR— two clearance lamps,
one at each side, and two
reflectors, one at or near the
front and one at or near the
rear*
► Brakes that can be operated by
the driver in the towing vehicle.
They must be designed and
connected so that they will
automatically stop the trailer
if it breaks away from the
towing vehicle.
► Pole trailer weighing more than
3,000 pounds:
► EACH SIDE—one side marker
lamp and one clearance lamp.
► REAR—two reflectors, one at
each side.*
* Every motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, and
pole trailer must have two or more stop lamps
(one stop lamp is permitted on vehicles built
before January 1, 1972).
Drawbar or Towing Connection
The drawbar/towing connection must:
► be strong enough to pull all towed
weight;
► not be more than 15 feet long
unless you are towing poles, pipes,
machinery, or other objects that
cannot be easily taken apart; and
► have a white flag at least 12 inches
square attached to it if it is chain,
rope, or cable.
The Oficial Florida Driver License Handbook—rev. 06/2022 5
Securing the Load
You must not drive or move any loaded
vehicle on the highway if the load is not
secure. The load must not be able to
drop, shif, leak, or otherwise escape.
► You must use a close-fitting cover
when hauling loads which could
fall or blow onto the roadway (e.g.,
dirt, sand, gravel).
► Every truck carrying logs or pulpwood must use lock chains to
securely fasten the load.
Projecting Load
A load that extends beyond the sides
of a vehicle and more than four feet or
more beyond its rear must be clearly
marked. During the day, red flags at
least 18 inches square must mark the
extremities of the load. Requirements
from sunset to sunrise, and during any
rain, smoke, or fog include:
► two red lamps on the back of the
load that can be seen from at least
500 feet to the rear;
► two red reflectors on the rear that
can be seen from 100 to 600 feet
when directly in front of low beam
headlights, and located to show
the load’s full width; and/or
► one red lamp on each side of the
load, visible from at least 500 feet
to show maximum overhang of
the load.
If the trailer or motor vehicle is transporting logs, pulpwood, poles, or posts
that extend more than four feet beyond
the rear of the load, you must have one
amber strobe-type lamp equipped so
that the lamp is visible from the rear
and both sides of the projecting load.
The lamp must be operational and
seen any time of day or night.
Passenger vehicles must not be driven
on any highway with a load extending
beyond the fenders on the lef side of
the vehicle or extending more than 6
inches beyond the line of the fenders
on the right side.
Slow Moving Vehicles
Farm vehicles designed for operation at
speeds less than 25 MPH must display
this sign on the rear when using public
highways (not limited
access/interstates).
Also, these vehicles
must only be operated during daylight
hours unless equipped with the proper
lights/reflectors required for night
driving.
 *Florida law states that a driver
must move out of the left lane
when being overtaken from behind
by another vehicle traveling at a
higher rate of speed.

El PREPARING TO DRIVE: YOU—THE DRIVER
Driving an automobile is a huge responsibility. In order to drive safely, you
must be fully engaged: hands on the wheel, eyes on the road, and mind on
driving. Anything that afects your physical or mental condition can impair
your ability to drive.
Physical Conditions
It is important that you get regular vision, hearing, and general physical checkups. Get treatment for illnesses and avoid driving when sick. Remember that
whenever you are prescribed medication, you should ask your doctor or pharmacist how it can afect your driving.
Emotions
Emotions can have an efect on driving safely. You may not be able to drive safely
if you are worried, excited, crying, angry, or depressed. Emotions can distract you
from your driving because your mind is focused on other issues, not driving. Your
emotional state can alter the way you react—or overreact—to driving situations.
Take time to calm down and get focused before driving.
Road Rage
Road rage is violent or visibly angry behavior by a driver which can res
crashes or other incidents on roadways. Signs include:
► sudden acceleration or braking,
► following too closely;
► cutting of other drivers;
► preventing other vehicles from merging into your lane;
► excessively hitting the horn or flashing headlights;
► shouting obscenities or threats;

Distracted Driving
Distracted driving is extremely risky
behavior that puts you and your
passengers in danger, as well as pedestrians and bicyclists sharing the road.
Focused attention on driving helps to
prevent crashes.
There are three main categories of
driver distraction:
Categories of Distraction
Visual taking your eyes of the road
Manual taking your hands of the
steering wheel
Cognitive thinking about anything
other than driving
Texting involves all three types of
distractions, making it one of the
most dangerous of distracted driving
behaviors.* However, this is not the
only cause of distracted driving. Other
common distractions include:
► talking on a cell phone;
► watching an object, person, or
event outside of the vehicle;
► reaching for an object;
► interacting with passengers;
► eating or drinking;
► unsecured pets;
► grooming;
► adjusting radio or climate controls;
► lighting a cigarette; and/or
► daydreaming.
* It is illegal in Florida to operate a motor vehicle
while texting. Florida law prohibits a person
from operating a motor vehicle while using a
wireless communications device in a handheld
manner in a designated school crossing, school
zone, or work zone.
Drinking & Driving
Alcohol reduces all of the skills necessary to drive safely, such as judgment,
reaction, vision, and concentration.
Alcohol is absorbed into the lining of
the stomach and then passes directly
into the bloodstream and reaches your
brain within minutes afer consumption. A person’s judgment is the first
thing afected afer drinking an
alcoholic beverage.
Even one drink of alcohol can afect
your driving. Alcohol slows your
reflexes and reaction time, reduces
your ability to see clearly, and makes
you less alert. You will have trouble
judging distance, speed, and movement of other vehicles. You will also
have trouble controlling your vehicle.
If you drink alcohol—even just one
drink—your chances of being in a crash
are much greater than if you did not
drink any alcohol. No one can drink
alcohol and drive safely, even if you
have been driving for many years.
Because drinking alcohol and driving
is so dangerous, the penalties are very
tough. People who drive afer drinking risk heavy fines, higher insurance
rates, loss of driver license, and even
jail sentences. A DUI (Driving Under the
Influence) conviction must remain on
your driving record for 75 years.
Do Not Drink and Drive!
► Before drinking, designate a sober
driver.
► If you are the designated driver,
do not drink. One drink is one
too many.
► If you are impaired—and did not
designate a driver—use a rideshare
service, call a sober friend or family
....................................................................PREPARING TO DRIVE: YOU—THE DRIVER
member, or use public transportation to get home safely.
► Remember, friends don’t let friends
drive drunk. If you know someone
who is about to drive impaired,
take their keys and help them get a
safe ride home.
Drowsy Driving
Drowsy driving can be just as dangerous as drunk driving. Do not drive when
you are tired. It is risky to drive drowsy
because fatigue (being sleepy) can:
► slow your thought processes and
reaction time;
► afect your judgment and vision;
► impair your senses and abilities;
and/or
► cause micro-sleeping (“nodding
of”) or falling completely asleep.
The two main causes of drowsy driving
are lack of quality/quantity of sleep
and driving at times of the day when
you would normally be sleeping. Avoid
driving drowsy!
► Don’t drive at times when you
would normally be asleep.
► Get a good night’s sleep before
you travel.
► On long trips, take a break every
100 miles or 2 hours.
► If you think you might fall asleep—
find a safe place to stop and take
a nap.
► Use the “buddy system” and switch
drivers when needed.
Drugged Driving
Driving while impaired by drugs is illegal and subject to the same penalties
as driving while impaired by alcohol.
Besides alcohol, there are many drugs
that can afect a person’s ability to
safely operate a vehicle. This is true
for many prescription drugs, as well
as over-the-counter medications for
allergies and colds. If a person is taking
medication, they should be sure to
check the label for warnings about the
medication’s efects prior to driving. If
they are not sure it is safe to take the
drug and drive, they should ask their
doctor or pharmacist about any side
efects.
Alcohol and drugs should not be
consumed at the same time. Mixing
alcohol and drugs ofen multiplies the
efects of the alcohol and any other
drugs. For example, one drink, when
you are also taking an allergy or cold
medication, could have the same efect
as several drinks.
Illegal drugs and controlled substances, such as marijuana, also afect
a person’s reflexes, judgment and
alertness along with their many other
dangerous side efects. These drugs
can give a person a false sense of
alertness and self-confidence or make
a person drowsy and unable to react to
simple situations.
Older Drivers
As we age, physical changes require
us to adapt so that we can continue to
drive safely. Older drivers should:
► get regular medical and eye exams
to identify physical and mental
conditions that may afect driving;
► ask the doctor or pharmacist how
medications—especially when
taken in combination with other
medications—afect driving;
► consult with a doctor about an
exercise program to maintain the

flexibility and strength needed for
safe driving;
► make vehicle adjustments as
necessary. If it becomes dificult
to turn the steering wheel, get a
steering knob. If you have dificulty turning your head to check
blind spots, get a larger side mirror;
► avoid wearing sunglasses in dim
or dark conditions; and
► avoid risky driving times:
► Dusk, dawn, and nighttime.
► Bad weather.
► Rush-hour trafic.
► Fast-paced highways.

Safety Belts & Child Restraints
Safety belts save lives, but only if worn correctly every time you are in a motor
vehicle! You are far more likely to be killed in a crash if you are not wearing a
safety belt. In a crash, your safety belt keeps you:
► from being ejected from the vehicle;
► from being thrown against other passengers, your steering wheel,
or windshield; and
► behind the wheel, where you can control the vehicle.
Wear both the lap belt and the shoulder belt. Wear your lap belt around your
hips and wear your shoulder belt across your chest. Your safety belt will not
work if it is tucked behind you. Airbags are not a substitute for safety belts!
Florida law requires that all drivers, all front seat passengers, and all passengers
under the age of 18 wear safety belts.* Children under age 4 must be in a safety
seat, and children ages 4 and 5 must be in either a safety seat or a booster seat.
Drivers will be charged with a safety belt/child restraint violation if any passenger
under the age of 18 is not restrained with the proper safety belt or child restraint
device. Passengers 18 years old or older will be charged with the violation if they
fail to wear a safety belt when required by law.
Each passenger on a school bus equipped with safety belts or restraint systems
shall wear a properly adjusted and fastened school safety belt at all times while
the school bus is in operation.
*Some exemptions apply to cars manufactured prior to 1968 and trucks prior to 1972.

Florida law exempts the following from the safety belt requirements:
► A person certified by a physician as having a medical condition that causes
safety belt use to be inappropriate or dangerous. (Keep a copy of certification
while driving/being driven.)
► Employee of a newspaper home delivery service while delivering newspapers.
► School buses purchased new prior to December 31, 2000.
► Buses used for transportation of persons for compensation.
► Farm equipment.
► Trucks of a net weight of more than 26,000 pounds.
► A safety belt (without booster seat) may only be used for children 4–5 years of
age when the driver is not a member of the child’s immediate family and the
child is being transported as a favor or in an emergency.
It is the parent or guardian’s responsibility to supply the proper child restraint
when transporting a child in a vehicle for hire (e.g., taxi, bus, limousine).
The best child seat is one that fits your child, fits your car, and that you will use
correctly every time. Read the car seat’s instruction manual and the portion of your
vehicle’s owner manual on car seat installation. In passenger vehicles, children
under 13 should be secured in the rear seat; airbags can injure or kill young children in the front seat. Never place a rear-facing car seat in front of an airbag.
Leaving Children Unsupervised in Motor Vehicles
Never leave a child unattended or unsupervised in a motor vehicle; it is extremely
dangerous and can result in the child’s injury or death! Florida law states that a
parent, legal guardian, or other person responsible for a child younger than 6 years
of age must not leave the child unattended or unsupervised for any period of
time if the motor of the vehicle is running, the health of the child is in danger,
or the child appears to be in distress. A violation of this law is a second-degree
misdemeanor; a violation that causes great bodily harm, permanent disability,
or permanent disfigurement to a child is considered a third-degree felony.

II TRAFFIC CONTROLS
Pavement Markings
Lines, symbols, and words are painted on roadways to help direct drivers
and control trafic flow. You must know what the diferent lines, colors, and
symbols mean and obey them.
Unless you are turning, exiting a highway, or changing lanes, always stay
between the lines marking your lane. Drivers may safely and briefly drive to
the lef of center on the roadway to overtake a bicycle, other non-motorized
vehicle, an electric bicycle, or a pedestrian.
Edge Lines
Solid lines along the side of the road mark the right or lef
edge of the roadway.
► Single solid white line. Marks the right edge of the
roadway.
► Single solid yellow line. Marks the lef edge of the
roadway on divided highways and one-way streets.
White Lane Lines
White lane lines separate lanes of trafic moving in the
same direction.
► Single broken white line. You may cross this line to
change lanes when it is safe to do so.
► Single solid white line. You may travel in the same
direction on both sides of this line, but do not cross the
line unless you must do so to avoid a hazard. Also used
to discourage lane changes near intersections.
► Double solid white lines. Crossing a double solid line/
changing lanes is not allowed.

“ONLY”: you must turn in the direction of the arrow.
► Lane is marked with both a curved and straight arrow:
you may either turn or go straight.
► Two-way roadway with center lane: drivers from either
direction may use the center lane for lef turns; you must
not use for passing.
Reversible Lanes
Some highways have reversible trafic lanes to help handle
rush-hour trafic. The direction of trafic is normally reversed
at set times each day. These lanes are marked with special
pavement markings, lane signals, and signs.
Bicycle Lanes
Some roads have pavement markings that show lanes specifically designated for the exclusive use of bicycles or for
shared use.
► Exclusive bike lane. Solid white lines separate these
bike lanes from motor vehicle travel lanes. Ofen marked
with bike lane signs/symbols.
► Shared-use lane. Marked with “sharrows.” These
markings alert motorists that bicyclists may use the
entire lane, indicate to bicyclists where to ride, and
discourage bicycling in the wrong direction.

Brown and White Signs. Point out scenic areas, parks, and
areas of cultural/historical significance.
Trafic Signals
Trafic signals are placed at intersections to keep trafic moving and to help
prevent crashes. Drivers, pedestrians, and bicycle riders must obey these signals
except when an oficer is directing trafic. If a trafic signal is out of order and
law enforcement is not present, treat the light/intersection as a four-way
stop sign (See Power Outage on page 54).
Steady Signal Lights
Red Light
► Come to a complete stop at the stop line. Remain stopped
until the light turns green.
► Don’t stop too far away from the stop line. Some signals
change only when sensors detect vehicles at the stop line.
► Afer stopping, you may turn right if there is not a NO TURN
ON RED sign and the way is clear.
► You may turn lef from a one-way street onto a one-way
street that has trafic moving to the lef.
► Before turning, you must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians in the crosswalk and oncoming trafic.
► Running (driving through) the red light is against the law
and is extremely dangerous!

Pedestrian Signals
Pedestrian signals show words or pictures to indicate when it is
safe—or not—to use the crosswalk.
WALK or Walking Person. You may begin to cross the street.
DON’T WALK or Raised Hand. Never enter the crosswalk or
begin crossing the street when the raised hand is flashing or
solid. If you are already in the crosswalk when this signal begins
flashing, quickly finish crossing the street.
Countdown Signal. The countdown starts at the beginning of

stops, use the crosswalk. Motorists must stop
and yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk.
High-Intensity Activated Crosswalk (HAWK)
► When approaching a pedestrian signal with no light, if the
intersection is clear, go.
► If there is a yellow flashing light, slow down, because this
light indicates that a pedestrian has activated the push
button. Approach at a speed that will allow you to stop if
the light changes.
► If there is a yellow steady light, prepare to stop.
► If there is a red steady light, stop for pedestrian in

Flashing Arrow Panels. Used both during the day and at
night to give advance warning and directional information
when it is necessary to move to another lane.
Flaggers. People who work in roadway construction/maintenance zones to stop, slow, or guide trafic safely through
the area. Flaggers wear bright colored/fluorescent vests or
jackets and use red flags or signs to direct trafic through
work zones.
...................................................................................................... TRAFFIC CONTROLS
Railroad Crossing Signs & Signals
There are several signs, signals, and pavement markings that
indicate highway-railroad crossings. When you see any of these,
slow down and be ready to stop. Do not stop on the railroad
tracks or within 15 feet of the crossing.
Any driver, bicyclist or pedestrian approaching a railroadhighway crossing must stop within 50 feet, but not less than
15 feet, from the nearest rail of the railroad when:
► the warning devices are flashing;
► the crossing gate is lowered;
► a human flagger is warning of an approaching train; and/or
► an approaching train is clearly visible.
Advance Warning Sign. This is usually the first sign you see
when approaching a highway-railroad crossing.
Crossbuck Sign. These are yield signs; you must yield the
right-of-way to trains. A sign below the crossbuck will show
the number of tracks if there is more than one track.
Flashing Red Light Signals. At many crossings, the crossbuck sign has flashing red lights and bells. When the lights
begin to flash, stop immediately! A train is approaching.
Pavement Marking. Markings may be painted on the paved
approach to a crossing before the stop line.
Dynamic Envelope. A series of roadway markings on the
area railroad crossings designed to keep motorists out of
the danger zone. White roadway markings in the shape of
connecting X’s found within dynamic envelopes are used to
visually highlight stopping distances at railroad crossings
to increase safety for motorists.
Gates. Many crossings have gates with flashing red lights
and bells. Stop when the lights begin to flash and before
the gate lowers across your road lane. It is against the law
to drive around or under a crossing gate—either down
or while being opened or closed—and it is extremely
dangerous.
Remember:
► Slow down when approaching railroad crossings.
► Be prepared to stop especially when following buses or
trucks; many are required to stop at railroad crossings
even when gates are up/lights are not flashing.
The Oficial Florida Driver License Handbook—rev. 06/2022 25
► If there is more than one track, make sure all tracks are
clear before crossing.
► In heavy trafic, make sure there is room for your vehicle
on the other side of the track before crossing.
► Trains ofen appear to be traveling at a slower speed
than they actually are, and they cannot stop quickly.
Don’t try to “beat the train;” the train always wins.
Drawbridge Signs & Signals
Drawbridges are mechanical bridges over navigable waters
that raise or turn to allow marine trafic to go under them.
Flashing Yellow Signal. When the yellow light is flashing,
the drawbridge is in operation. Slow down and prepare to
stop.
Drawbridge Signal
► Red. Come to a complete stop at the marked stop line.
The bridge is in operation and the roadway is closed to
all pedestrian and motor vehicle trafic.
► Yellow. The light is about to turn red. Stop if you can
safely do so. The bridge is about to start operation.
► Green. Proceed with caution.
Gates. Many drawbridges have gates with flashing red lights
and bells. Stop when the lights begin to flash and before the
gate lowers across your road lane.
It is against the law to drive around or under a crossing
gate—either down or while being opened or closed—and it is
extremely dangerous.

El DRIVING SAFELY
Speed Limits
Obeying the speed limit reduces the probability and severity of crashes.
Speeding is extremely dangerous. The faster you drive, the greater the
impact or striking power of your vehicle:
► When you double the speed of a car, you increase its force of impact
four times.
► When you triple the speed of a car, you increase its force of impact
nine times.
Speeding is against the law. You must obey the speed limit and you are
responsible for knowing the speed limit when you are driving. (The
“speeding bufer” is a myth; you are not “allowed” to drive up to 10 MPH
over the speed limit.) Observe and obey posted speed limit signs. Speeding
is the #1 citation written for teens. (Source: FLHSMV)
Florida Standard Speed Limits
School Zones 20 MPH
Municipal, Business, or Residential Area 30 MPH*
Streets and Highways 55 MPH*
Limited Access Highways (See page 34) 70 MPH
 *Maximum speed except where otherwise posted.
Speed limits show the fastest speed you may drive under favorable conditions. You are responsible for adjusting your driving speed to the weather,
roadway, and trafic conditions. For example, during a storm, you should
drive slower than the posted speed limit. The safest speed is the one that
allows you to have complete control of your vehicle and avoid collisions.
However, driving too slowly is also against Florida law. You must not drive
so slowly that you block or delay trafic moving at normal, safe speeds. You
should drive with the flow of trafic, within the speed limit. When driving slower
than the flow of trafic, keep right so others may safely pass. On highways,
when the posted speed limit is 70 MPH, the minimum speed limit is 50 MPH.

Braking Distance
Perception Distance. How far your vehicle travels—in favorable weather
conditions—from the time your eyes see a hazard until your brain recognizes
it. Perception distance can be affected by mental and physical conditions, medication, as well as visibility and the hazard itself. The average perception
time for an alert driver is ¾ second to 1 second. END ZONE
END ZONE
Reaction Distance. How far you will continue to travel afer seeing the hazard
until you physically hit the brakes. The average driver has a reaction time of ¾
second to 1 second. At 50 MPH, this accounts for 55 feet traveled.
Braking Distance. How far your vehicle will travel—in favorable weather conditions— while you are braking. At 50 MPH, on dry pavement and with good brakes,
it can take about 158 feet.
High speeds greatly increase stopping distances and severity of crashes. The faster
you drive, the greater the impact or striking power of your vehicle.
► Doubling the speed means the braking distance and impact are 4 times greater.
► Tripling the speed means the braking distance and impact are 9 times greater.
(Stopping distance is equal to a football field.)
► Quadrupling the speed means the braking distance and impact are 16 times
greater.
Total Stopping Distance. The total minimum distance your vehicle will travel—
including perception distance, reaction distance, and braking distance—until you
can bring your vehicle to a complete stop. At 50 MPH, you will travel a minimum of
268 feet...nearly the length of a football field.
Right Turn* Slow or Stop Left Turn
.....................................................................................................DRIVING SAFELY
Smooth Stops
Stopping suddenly is dangerous and is
usually caused by not paying attention
to the trafic flow or following others
too closely. Sudden stops make it
dificult for drivers behind you to avoid
a rear-end collision. To ensure you are
stopping smoothly:
► Check all mirrors and blind spots
for trafic to the rear.
► Release the accelerator to allow
the vehicle to slow. Press the brake
pedal to activate brake lights and
use a steady pressure.
Making Turns
► You must use vehicle directional
signals or hand signals to show
other drivers that you are turning.
► Turn signals are also required by
law when changing lanes or
overtaking a vehicle.
► You must give a turn signal for at
least 100 feet BEFORE you make
your turn.
► It is against the law to use your
directional signals to tell drivers
behind you that they can pass.
► Hand signals must be given from
the lef side of the vehicle.
* Note: Bicyclists may extend right hand and arm
horizontally from right side of bicycle
for right turn.
Turning a corner may seem to be a simple operation, but many trafic crashes
are caused by drivers who do not turn
correctly.
1. Slow down to a safe turning
speed.
2. Move into the correct lane as you
near the intersection. The correct
lane for a right turn is the rightmost lane.
3. You must activate your turn signal
at least 100 feet before making
your turn. Allow time for drivers
around you to see your signal
before you move.
4. Obey any NO TURN ON RED or
STOP HERE signs.
5. Yield to bicyclists when crossing a
bike lane and to pedestrians who
may be crossing your path.
6. Stay in the proper lane during your
turn. Yield the right-of-way to
vehicles and bicycles coming from
the opposite direction.
7. Finish your turn in the proper lane.
Turn right into the right lane of the
roadway entered. A lef turn may
be completed in any lane lawfully
available—or safe—for the desired
direction of travel.
Never make last minute turns. If you
reach an intersection where you wish to
turn and are not in the proper lane, drive
to the next intersection and then make
the turn from the proper lane.

Three-Point Turn
Sometimes you will need to turn
around in a very small space. Use a
three-point turn only if the road is too
narrow for a U-turn and you can’t go
around the block.
To make a three-point turn:
1. Move as far right as possible,
check trafic, and signal a lef
turn. Turn the steering wheel
sharply to the lef and move
forward slowly. Stop at the curb.
2. Shif to reverse, turn your wheels
sharply to the right, check
trafic, and back your vehicle to
the right curb.
3. Shif the vehicle into drive and
pull forward carefully.
Never make a three-point turn or a
U-turn on a curve, a hill, the highway,
or where there is a sign that prohibits
U-turns.
Intersections
Many intersections are marked with
stop lines to show where you must
come to a complete stop. Always stop
behind stop lines. After a complete
stop, you must yield the right-of-way to
all other trafic already in the intersection and to pedestrians. Move forward
only when the road is clear.
Vehicles proceed through the intersection in the order that they arrived at the
intersection; the first vehicle to reach
the intersection should move forward
first. If vehicles arrive at approximately
the same time, each driver must yield to
the drivers on their right.
At a two-way stop, the turning vehicle
yields to the vehicle going straight.
Right-of-way rules tell you who
goes first and who must wait in
diferent conditions. The law says
who must yield (give up) the rightof-way. Every driver, motorcyclist, moped rider, pedestrian,
and bicyclist must do everything
possible to avoid a crash.
Open Intersections
An open intersection is one without
trafic control signs or signals. When
you enter an open intersection, you
must yield the right-of-way if:
► a vehicle is already in the
intersection;
► you enter or cross a state highway
from a secondary road;
► you enter a paved road from an
unpaved road; or
► you plan to make a lef turn and
a vehicle is approaching from the
opposite direction.
.....................................................................................................DRIVING SAFELY
Roundabouts
A roundabout is a circular intersection
with no trafic signal.
► Roundabouts travel in a one-way
counter-clockwise direction.
► Drivers entering the roundabout
must yield to trafic already in the
roundabout.
► If there is no trafic in the roundabout, you may enter without
yielding.
► Do not change lanes in the
roundabout.
► Do not stop in a roundabout.
► Signal before exiting the
roundabout.
Multi-Lane Roundabouts. These
have the same rules as single-lane
roundabouts, however you will need to
choose the proper lane prior to entering
the roundabout. To go straight or right,
use the right lane. To go straight or lef,
and to make a U-turn, use the lef lane.
Prior to entering or exiting the roundabout, drivers must yield to pedestrians
in the crosswalks. Bicyclists may take
the lane in the roundabout or use the
sidewalk.
Driveways
Drivers entering a road from a driveway, alley, or roadside must yield to
vehicles already on the main road, as
well as to pedestrians and bicyclists on
the sidewalk or in bike lanes.
Trafic Lanes
On a two-lane highway you must
always drive in the right lane unless
you are overtaking and passing (where
permitted).
If the road has four or more lanes with
two-way trafic, drive in the right lanes
except when overtaking and passing.
The center lane of a three-lane or fivelane highway is used only for turning
lef.
HOV Lanes
Some highways reserve the lef lane
for vehicles with two or more occupants
or hybrid/low emission vehicles (LEV).
LEVs require a decal and completion
of FLHSMV Form 83027. These High
Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes are
identified by signs/diamond pavement
symbols, and are separated by a striped
bufer zone. Vehicles may enter and exit
the HOV lane only at designated points.
Bike Lanes
Motorized vehicles are not allowed to
drive in bike lanes; they may cross over
them when turning at intersections,
but only when no bicyclists are present
in the bike lane.
Red Reflectors on Lane Lines
Red reflectors on lane lines always
mean you are facing trafic the wrong
way and could have a head-on collision.
The Oficial Florida Driver License Handbook—rev. 06/2022 31
32 ©2022 Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
																																																																																																																																
► If you see red reflectors facing Increase your following distance in
you on the lane lines, you are on these situations:
the wrong side of the road. Turn
around or get into the proper
lane immediately!
► If you see red reflectors on the edge
lines of the road, you are going the
wrong way on an entrance or exit
ramp. Pull over immediately! Turn
around when it is safe to do so.
Safe Following Distances
Rear-end collisions are almost always
caused by drivers following too closely.
Maintaining a large enough following
distance (the space between you and
the vehicle in front of you) greatly
helps avoid a collision with the vehicle in front of you. The more distance
between your vehicle and others, the
more time you have to react. Keep a
minimum following distance of four
seconds during favorable weather and
trafic conditions. (Increase following
distance during unfavorable weather
or trafic conditions.)
To determine following distance:
1. Watch when the rear of the vehicle
ahead passes a stationary marker
such as a sign or light pole.
2. Count the seconds it takes you
to reach the same marker: “Onethousand-one, one-thousand-two,
one-thousand-three, one-thousandfour.”
3. If you pass the stationary marker
before counting to one-thousandfour, you are following too closely.
4. Reduce speed and then count
again at another stationary point.
Repeat until you are following no
closer than four-seconds.
► Rain or when roads are wet.
► Low visibility—dusk, dawn,
nighttime, fog, etc.
► When being passed (more space in
front of your vehicle so the pass
can be completed safely).
► Carrying a heavy load or pulling a
trailer. (The extra weight makes it
more dificult to stop quickly/steer
correctly.)
► When stopped behind another
vehicle on an incline; it may roll
back before moving forward.
► When following:
► Motorcycles. The chances of a
motorcyclist falling are greater
on wet or gravel roads, or
metal surfaces such as bridges.
You will need extra stopping/
steering distance to avoid
hitting the motorcycle/rider.
► Emergency vehicles. It is
against the law to follow a fire
truck responding to an
emergency closer than 500
feet.
► Vehicles required to come to
a stop at railroad crossings,
such as city buses, school
buses, and vehicles carrying
hazardous materials.
► Vehicles with a blocked rear
view. Drivers of trucks, buses,
vans, or vehicles pulling
trailers may not be able to see
your vehicle when you are
directly behind them.
If your vehicle is being followed too
closely, slow down and keep to the right.

Blind Spots (approximate)
.....................................................................................................DRIVING SAFELY
Following Distance for Trucks
A truck or any vehicle towing another
vehicle must not follow within 300 feet
of another truck or another vehicle in
tow. This law does not apply to overtaking and passing, and it does not apply
within cities or towns.
Blind Spots
Blind spots are areas near the lef and
right rear corners of your vehicle that
you can’t see in your rear-view mirrors
or with your peripheral vision.
Before you move to change lanes on
a highway, pass on any road, or make
certain turns, turn your head to make
sure these areas are clear. Do not drive
in someone else’s blind spot. Move
forward or drop back so that the other
driver can see you.The larger the vehicle, the larger the blind spots. Large
trucks and SUVs have blind spots close
to the rear of the vehicle that cannot
be seen in rear-view mirrors. (See No
Zones on page 44.)
Passing
1. You must activate your signal
before moving into the lef lane
to let others know that you are
about to change lanes to pass.
2. Stay a safe distance behind the
vehicle you want to pass—the
closer you get, the less you can
see ahead.
3. Before you pull out to pass,
check blind spots and make sure
that you have plenty of time and
room to pass.
4. Tap your horn (day) or flash your
headlights (night) to let the other
driver know you are passing.
5. Do not return to the right side of
the road until you can see the
tires of the vehicle you passed in
your rear-view mirror. Signal
when you are about to return to
your lane.
6. You must return to the right side
of the road before coming within
200 feet of any approaching
vehicle.
Do not attempt to pass more than
one vehicle at a time. Passing multiple
vehicles is dangerous.
Stay within the speed limit. It’s
illegal to exceed the speed limit
while passing.
Passing on the Right
Passing on the right is only legal when
there are two or more lanes of traffic
moving in the same direction or the
vehicle you are passing is making a
left turn.
The Oficial Florida Driver License Handbook—rev. 06/2022 33
34 ©2022 Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
																																																																																																																																
You Must Not Pass:
► where there is a single solid, or
double-sided solid line dividing
lanes;
► when the double-sided yellow line
is solid in your lane;
► in Do Not Pass and No Passing
zones;
► on hills or curves where you can’t
see at least 500 feet ahead;
► within 100 feet of an intersection,
bridge, viaduct, tunnel, or railroad
crossing;
► when a school bus is stopped
and has its warning flashers on and
stop sign extended; and
► at crosswalks where a vehicle has
stopped to allow a pedestrian to
cross.
Being Passed
You must not increase your speed while
you are being passed. Move to the right
side of your lane to give passing drivers
more room and a better view of the
road ahead.
Limited Access Highways
Limited access highways—also called
expressways, interstate highways,
turnpikes, toll roads, and freeways—
are multiple-lane roads with no stop
signs, trafic lights, or railroad crossings. Pedestrians, hitchhikers, bicycles,
animal-drawn vehicles, and motor-driven
cycles/motor scooters (with 150 cubic
centimeter displacement or less) are not
allowed on limited-access highways.
Entering & Leaving Limited
Access Highways
All limited access highway entrances
have three basic parts: an entrance
ramp, an acceleration lane, and a
merging area.
When entering a limited access
highway:
1. On the entrance ramp, begin
checking for an opening in trafic.
Signal your intent to merge onto
the highway.
2. Increase your speed as the ramp
straightens into the acceleration
lane. Adjust your speed so that you
can safely merge into the trafic
when you reach the end of the
acceleration lane.
3. Merge into trafic when you can do
so safely. You must yield the rightof-way to trafic on the highway.
Do not stop in the acceleration lane
unless trafic is too heavy and there
is no space for you to enter safely.
When leaving a limited access highway:
1. Get into the exit lane. Most exits
are from the right lane.
2. Activate your turn signal to show
your intention to exit.
3. Slow down in the deceleration
lane. Check the posted safe speed
for the exit ramp.
4. Don’t make last-minute turns into
an exit. If you pass your exit, you
must go to the next one.
Stay a safe distance behind the vehicle you want to pass. The closer you get, the less you can see.

Limited Access Highway Safety Reminders
Plan ahead. Know your exits. In Florida, they match the mile markers on the highway.
Drive in the right lane and pass on the lef. While in the right lane, watch for cars
entering the highway. Adjust your speed or move over so they can enter safely.
Never drive across or park on the median.
Never stop on the pavement, shoulder, or connecting ramp except in an emergency.
If your vehicle breaks down, you must move it completely of the pavement. (No more
than six hours.)
Don’t follow too closely. Rear-end collisions are the greatest danger on limited access
highways.
Never back up on an entrance ramp or exit ramp. The ONLY exception to this is if you
see a WRONG WAY or DO NOT ENTER sign or red reflectors on lane lines. You must back
up or turn around.
Stop driving when you feel tired. Do not risk falling asleep at the wheel.
Obey the Move Over law (See page 44).

Parking It is against the law to park:
► On crosswalks
► On sidewalks
► In bicycle lanes
► In intersections
► On bridges
► On overpasses
► In tunnels
► In front of driveways
► By yellow painted curbs
► In NO PARKING or DISABLED
PERMIT ONLY zones
► On the roadway side of another
parked vehicle (double parking)
► On highway pavement not marked
for parking
► Anywhere that blocks or creates a
hazard for other vehicles
► Or within:
► 15 feet of a fire hydrant.
► 20 feet of an intersection.
► 20 feet of the entrance to a fire,
ambulance, or rescue station.
► 30 feet of a rural mailbox on a
state highway (8 am–6 pm).
► 30 feet of any flashing signal,
stop sign, or trafic signal.
► 50 feet of a railroad crossing.
When parking on a public road, move
as far away from trafic as possible.
You must not park more than 12
inches away from the curb. If there is
a roadside shoulder, pull as far onto it
as you can.
Always park on the right side of the
roadway unless it is a one-way street.
Park parallel to the curb in the direction
of trafic movement, with right-hand
wheels parallel to and within 12 inches
of the right hand curb or side of roadway. Set the parking brake and shif
to Park (automatic transmission) or
Reverse (manual transmission). Turn of
the engine and lock the vehicle. Florida
law requires that you take the keys out
of your vehicle before leaving it.
Always check trafic around you before
getting out of the vehicle so you do
not open your door into a bicyclist or
another vehicle.
Before you drive from any parked position, make sure the roadway is clear.
Give the proper turn signal and yield to
other trafic before pulling away from
the curb.
Parking on Hills
1. Turn your wheels so that if your
car starts to move, it will roll
away from trafic or into the
curb.
2. Set the parking brake.

SHARING THE ROAD B
Sharing the Road with Pedestrians
It is the motorist’s responsibility to do everything possible to avoid colliding
with a pedestrian (person walking). When in a crosswalk or driveway, bicyclists, skaters, and skateboarders are considered pedestrians.
Rules for Motorists
1. You must stop and remain stopped for pedestrians crossing a street or
driveway at any marked crossing, driveway, or intersection.
2. When entering or leaving an alley, driveway, or private road, you must stop
for pedestrians on the sidewalk.
3. Never block the crosswalk when stopped at a red light. Do not stop with
any portion of your vehicle overhanging the crosswalk.
4. Florida law prohibits you from overtaking and passing a vehicle that is
stopped at a crosswalk so that a pedestrian can cross the roadway. A
driver approaching a vehicle from the rear that is stopped at a crosswalk
must assume that a pedestrian may be crossing, even when none can be
seen at that moment.
5. Always stop before turning right on red and look both ways for pedestrians
in the crosswalk.
6. Come to a complete stop, yield the right-of-way, and use extra caution
when approaching:
► a visually impaired pedestrian who is carrying a white cane with a red
tip or guided by a service animal;
► mobility-impaired persons (using a walker, a crutch, or an orthopedic
cane or wheelchair) and pedestrians using a guide dog or service
animal; or
► children or any confused or incapacitated pedestrian.
Rules for Pedestrians
1. Pedestrians must not walk on the roadway if a sidewalk is available.
2. When walking along a roadway without a sidewalk, always walk on the
shoulder on the lef side, facing trafic.
3. Cross the road at intersections or designated crosswalks. Crosswalks at
intersections may be marked or unmarked.
4. Pedestrians must yield the right-of-way to vehicles if crossing a roadway at
any point other than within a crosswalk.
5. Pedestrians must yield the right-of-way to vehicles in the crosswalk if the
crosswalk signal is red or displays DON’T WALK.

Pedestrian Safety Tips Rules for Motorists
► Never enter the street from between
parked cars. Always use a crosswalk.
► Stop at the curb or the edge of the
road if there is no curb. Look lef,
then right, then lef again for
moving vehicles before you step
into the street.
► Be seen. Wear bright, reflective,
neon colors. Carry a flashlight
at night.
► Don’t text while walking.
► Avoid wearing headphones so that
you can hear the trafic around you.
Sharing the Road
with Bicycles
In Florida, the bicycle is legally defined
as a vehicle and has all of the privileges,
rights, and responsibilities on public
roads (except limited access highways)
that a motor vehicle operator does.
Bicyclists may ride out of the bike lane
into the travel lane for their own safety
due to narrow roads, to avoid obstacles
or pavement hazards, or to prepare for
a lef turn. A bicyclist may use the full
lane even while traveling substantially
below the speed of trafic if the lane is
too narrow for both a car and bicycle
to share.
Unlike motorists, bicyclists may also
operate on sidewalks, but they must
yield to pedestrians on sidewalks and
in crosswalks.
1. Florida law requires that you give
bicyclists a minimum of three feet
of clearance and use caution/slow
speed when driving alongside or
passing them.
2. On a two-lane road, pass a bicyclist as you would a slow-moving
vehicle, and only when it is safe to
do so.
3. At intersections, always assume
that bicyclists are traveling straight
unless they signal otherwise. Yield
to bicycles just as you would to any
other vehicle.
4. When crossing a bike lane to make
a turn, yield to any bicyclist in the
bike lane and make your turn
behind the bicyclist.
5. Do not follow a bicyclist too closely.
6. At night, avoid using high beam
headlights when you see a bicyclist
approaching.
7. Before opening a car door, check
for bicyclists who may be
approaching from behind.
8. Avoid honking your horn and
startling a bicyclist.
Rules for Bicyclists
1. Bicyclists must obey all trafic
controls and signals.
2. If bicyclists are not traveling at the
speed of other trafic, they must
use the bike lane. If no bike lane is
available, they must stay on the
right-most side of the road.
Right-of-way rules tell you who goes first and who must wait in diferent
conditions. The law says who must yield (give up) the right-of-way. Every
driver, motorcyclist, moped rider, pedestrian, and bicyclist must do
everything possible to avoid a crash.
...............................................................................................SHARING THE ROAD
3. Bicyclists are allowed to use the
full lane when making a lef turn,
passing, avoiding hazards, or
when a lane is too narrow for
them and a car to share it safely.
4. When operating a bicycle on a
one-way street with two or more
trafic lanes, bicyclists may ride
on the lef-hand side of the road.
5. Bicyclists must use directional
hand signals to show other
drivers that they are about to
turn. (See page 41.)
6. Bicyclists must never attach
themselves or their bike to any
vehicle on the roadway.
7. If they are riding on a sidewalk or
crosswalk, bicyclists have all the
rights and duties a of a pedestrian. However, they must yield
the right-of-way to pedestrians
and must give an audible signal
before passing pedestrians.
8. Between sunset and sunrise,
bicyclists must have a white light
visible from 500 feet on the front
of their bicycle and a red reflector and a red light visible from
600 feet on the rear.
8. Bicyclists must have brakes
which can stop their bike within
25 feet from a speed of 10 MPH.
9. All bicyclists and passengers
under age 16 are required to
wear helmets that meet federal
safety standards.
10. If bicyclists are transporting
a child under age four, or who
weighs 40 pounds or less, they
must use a backpack/sling, child
seat, or trailer designed to carry
children.
11. Bicyclists must not leave a child
in a seat or carrier when they
are not in immediate control of
the bicycle.
12. If bicyclists are riding with
others, they may not ride more
than two side-by-side unless it
is a path or part of a roadway
reserved for bicycles. They must
ride single file if they and the
other rider are impeding trafic.
13. Bicyclists must not wear headphones/earbuds while bicycling
on the roadway.
14. Bicyclists must not ride a bicycle
when under the influence of
alcohol or drugs.
Bicyclist Safety Tips
► No matter your age, wear a helmet.
► Keep both hands on the handlebars.
► On the roadway, check behind you
before changing lanes or moving
notably within the lane.
► Be seen. Wear neon or fluorescent
colors when riding and wear
something reflective.
► Don’t text while biking.

Motorcycle Awareness Rules for Motorists
► You must never attempt to share
the lane with a motorcycle. The
motorcyclist is entitled to the
entire lane.
► Watch for motorcycles and look
carefully before pulling into an
intersection or changing lanes.
► It is dificult to gauge the speed of a
motorcycle because they take up
less field of vision which interferes
with depth perception. They may
appear to be much farther away
than they really are.
► Do not follow too closely behind a
motorcycle; remember that
motorcycles have the ability to
stop more quickly than other
vehicles.
► Motorcyclists ofen slow down by
down-shifing or rolling of the
throttle, thus not activating the
brake light.
► Never pass a motorcyclist with only
a few feet of space. The force of the
wind gust can cause the rider to
lose control.
► When your vehicle is being passed
by a motorcycle, maintain your
lane position. Do not increase your
speed.
► Maintain more than a four-second
bufer zone between you and a
motorcyclist, and increase space
when encountering these conditions: inclement weather, gusty
winds, wet or icy roads, bad road
conditions such as potholes, gravel
roads, and railroad crossings.
Motorcycle and moped drivers have
the same rights and duties as drivers
of motor vehicles. Riders committing
trafic violations may receive citations.
Laws for Motorcycle/
Moped Riders
► You must be 16 years of age or
older to operate a motorcycle or
moped on a public road.
► If under 18, you must hold a
learner’s license for 12 months
with no moving violation convictions prior to the issuance of a
Motorcycle Only license.
► Operators of motorcycles must
complete an approved motorcycle
safety course and get a motorcycle
endorsement on their driver
license or a Motorcycle Only
license.
► Operators of mopeds must have
the minimum of a Class E driver
license. No motorcycle endorsement is required.
► Operators of motorcycles must
wear a helmet unless they are over
the age of 21 AND carry a medical
insurance policy providing for at
least $10,000 in medical benefits
for injuries.
► Motorcycles and mopeds:
► must be registered annually
and have the proper tag; and
► must not be operated on
bicycle paths or foot paths.
► Operators of motorcycles and
mopeds do not have to carry
Personal Injury Protection (PIP)
insurance.

...............................................................................................SHARING THE ROAD
School Buses
It is against the law for any driver to pass a school bus when the school
bus displays a stop signal.
On a two-way street or highway, all drivers moving in either direction must
stop for a stopped school bus that is picking up or dropping of children. You
must remain stopped until the stop signal is withdrawn and all children are
clear of the roadway.
If the highway is divided by a raised barrier or an unpaved median at least five
feet wide, you do not have to stop if you are moving in the opposite direction
of the bus. Painted lines or pavement markings are not considered barriers.
You must always stop if you are moving in the same direction as the bus and you
must remain stopped until the stop signal is withdrawn.
UNPAVED BARRIER OR
TWO LANE MULTI-LANE PAVED ACROSS DIVIDED HIGHWAY
Vehicles traveling in
both directions
MUST stop.
Vehicles traveling in both directions
 MUST stop. Vehicles behind bus MUST stop.
Vehicles traveling in the opposite
direction ust proceed with caution.
Unpaved space 5 +/raised edian/physical barrier.
School Crossings
School area signs advise drivers of school zones and school crossings. School
zones and school crossings provide students with a safe zone when they cross
the road to and from school.
Crossing guards are the first to enter and last to exit a crosswalk to indicate
that pedestrians, especially children, are about to cross or are crossing. When
children or school crossing guards are present in a crosswalk, you must
yield and stop at the stop line and not in the crosswalk.
The Oficial Florida Driver License Handbook—rev. 06/2022 43

Emergency Vehicles
Motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians
must yield the right-of-way to law
enforcement vehicles, fire engines,
and other emergency vehicles using
sirens or flashing lights. Pull over
to the closest edge of the roadway
immediately and stop until the emergency vehicle has passed. Do not
block intersections.
Florida’s Move Over Law
The Move Over Law protects law
enforcement officers, emergency
workers, tow truck drivers, sanitation
workers, utility workers and road and
bridge maintenance or construction
vehicles displaying warning lights
stopped along roadways while performing their jobs.
Move Over Law
On a Multi-Lane Roadway
You must vacate the lane closest to the
stationary law enforcement, emergency
vehicle, tow truck, sanitation, or utility
vehicle. (Signal your intention to change
lanes.)
If you cannot move over safely, you must
slow down to a speed of 20 MPH below
the posted speed limit.
Drivers who are not in the lane closest to
the stationary vehicle should be prepared
to allow those who are about to move over
into their lane.
On a Two-Lane Roadway
You must slow down to a speed of 20
MPH below the posted speed limit.
If the speed limit is 20 MPH or less,
you must travel at 5 MPH.
Funeral Processions
Motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians
must yield the right-of-way to funeral
processions. When the funeral lead
vehicle enters an intersection, the
remaining vehicles in the funeral
procession may follow through the
intersection regardless of any trafic
control devices. All vehicles in the procession should have their headlights
on (and may also use flashing hazard
lights) as a signal to other drivers not
to drive between or interfere with the
funeral procession.
Public Transit
All drivers shall yield the right-of-way
to public transit buses traveling in the
same direction that have signaled and
are reentering the trafic flow from a
specifically designated pullout bay.
Commercial Motor Vehicles
Sharing the road with commercial
motor vehicles (CMVs) such as semitrucks or travel buses means abiding
by diferent rules and safety strategies.
Rules for Motorists
1. Stay out of the “No Zone.” CMVs
have large blind spots in front,
behind, and on both sides of the
vehicle. Even though large vehicles have several rear-view
mirrors, other vehicles will be
hidden from view if within the
“No Zone”/blind spot.
2. Don’t tailgate; you’ll be in the rear
blind spot and may collide with the
CMV if it stops unexpectedly.
...................................................................................................... SHARING THE ROAD
Orange areas show the “No Zone.”
3. If you are stopped behind a CMV on
an upgrade, leave space in case the
CMV drifs back when it starts to
move. Also, keep to the lef in your
lane so the driver can see that
you’re stopped behind the CMV.
4. Don’t use high beam headlights
when following a CMV at night.
Bright lights will blind the driver
when they reflect of the CMV’s
large side mirrors.
5. When a CMV is coming from the
opposite direction, keep to the
right to avoid a sideswipe crash.
6. CMVs ofen need to swing wide to
the lef in order to make a right
turn. Do not drive between the
CMV and the curb—they will not
be able to see you.
7. Never cross behind a CMV that
is preparing to back up or is in
the process of doing so. The size
of most CMVs and trailers completely hide objects behind them
from view.
Passing Commercial Vehicles
► When passing a CMV, first check to
your front and rear, and move into
the passing lane only if it is clear
and safe to pass. You must signal
that you are changing lanes, and
let the CMV driver know you are
passing by blinking your headlights, especially at night.
► Pass CMVs on the lef side for
maximum visibility. Complete your
pass as quickly as possible so that
you do not remain in the CMV’s
blind spot.
► Avoid cutting in too soon when
passing a CMV. Large CMVs can’t
stop as quickly as other vehicles.
Be sure you can see the cab in your
rear-view mirror before completing
your pass. (CMV drivers may flash
headlights to let you know it is OK
to merge back into the lane.)
► Avoid passing a CMV on a downgrade; the CMV’s weight and
momentum will cause it to
increase speed.
► When a CMV passes you, keep to
the right side of your lane. Do not
speed up while the CMV is passing.
The Oficial Florida Driver License Handbook—rev. 06/2022 45
Golf Carts
You may only drive a golf cart on golf courses or roadways that are designated
for golf carts. These roads will be marked with appropriate signs.
► A golf cart must not be driven by
anyone under the age of 14 on
public roads or streets.
► A golf cart must only be operated
during the hours between sunrise
and sunset, unless the local
government allows them to be
driven outside of those hours
(additional equipment is required
for night driving.)*
► Golf carts may not be operated AT
ALL unless allowed by the specific
county or city.
► You may cross state roads if the
posted speed limit is 45 MPH or
less and only at an intersection
with a trafic control device.
Required Equipment for Golf Carts
Eficient brakes
Rear-view mirror
Reliable steering
Red warning reflectors on front and rear
Safe tires
*Required for Night Driving
Headlights
Brake lights
Turn signals
Windshield
► You can drive a golf cart on a sidewalk only if it is at least 5 feet wide. You
must yield to pedestrians.
► You can drive a golf cart on a two-lane county road in a city that designates
it may be used for golf carts.
► All local and state trafic laws must be obeyed, including yielding the
right-of-way.
Low-Speed Vehicles
Low-speed vehicles (LSV) are four-wheeled vehicles with top speeds of 21–25
MPH. Golf carts can be converted to low-speed vehicles and vice versa. You must
have a valid driver license to operate an LSV, and the LSV must:
► only be operated on streets where the posted speed limit is 35 MPH or less.
► be equipped with headlamps, stop lamps, turn signals, tail lamps, reflex
reflectors, parking brakes, rear-view mirrors, a wind shield, safety belts,
and a vehicle identification number.
► be registered and properly insured (see page 57).

II SPECIAL DRIVING SITUATIONS
Night Driving
You will need to drive with extra care at night. You can’t see as far ahead and the
glare from oncoming cars can reduce your vision even more. Florida law says
you must:
► Use headlights between the hours of sunset and sunrise.
► Not use high beam headlights within 500 feet of an oncoming vehicle;
use low beam headlights.
► Not use high beam headlights within 300 feet of the vehicle ahead of you;
use low beam headlights.
► Not drive using only parking lights in place of headlights.
► Turn on your parking lights at night when you are parked on a roadway or
shoulder outside of cities and towns.
Follow these guidelines for driving at night:
► Avoid “over driving” your lights (driving too fast for what you can see).
► High beam headlights can reveal objects up to a distance of 450 feet and
are most efective for speeds faster than 25 MPH.
► When leaving a brightly lit area, drive slowly until your eyes adjust to the
darkness.
► Don’t look directly at oncoming headlights. Use lane lines as visual guides
and look quickly to check the other vehicle’s position every few seconds.
► Drive as far to the right as you can if a vehicle with one light comes toward
you; it could be a vehicle with a missing headlight.
High beam headlights can reveal objects up to a distance of at least 45 feet and are most eective for speeds faster than 25 MPH.
At night, glare from oncoming cars can reduce your vision.
The Oficial Florida Driver License Handbook—rev. 06/2022 47
48 ©2022 Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
																																																																																																																																
Low Visibility
Smoke from wildfires and controlled
burning, fog and heavy rain will afect
your ability to see. When driving in low
visibility conditions:
► You must turn on your headlights.
Parking lights are not a substitute.
► Drive with lights on low beam. High
beams will reflect of the fog and
impair visibility even more.
► Turn on your headlights when you
turn on your windshield wipers.
► Use wipers and defrosters for
maximum visibility. Sometimes it is
dificult to determine if poor
visibility is due to fog or moisture
on the windshield.
► Use the right edge of the road or
edge lines and center lines as
visual guides.
► Eliminate all distractions in your
vehicle. Turn of the radio, cell
phone, etc.
► Watch out for slow-moving and
parked vehicles.
► Keep your windshield and headlights clean to reduce glare and
increase visibility.
Rain
When you turn on your windshield wipers, turn on your headlights.
Slow down! Roads become slick
during rainstorms and especially if it
has not rained in a while (oil build-up
on the highway). Wet road conditions
will increase your braking/stopping
distance, so be sure to increase your
following distance.
Hydroplaning happens when your vehicle slides on top of a thin layer of water
between your tires and the road. When
your tires are not touching the road,
you can easily lose control and skid.
Tires with low air pressure or bad tread
increase the risk of hydroplaning— and
so does speeding. (See page 52 for
safety tips during hydroplaning.)
Brakes ofen become wet afer driving
in heavy rain. They may pull to one side
or the other, or they may not hold at all.
If this happens, slow down and gently
push on the brake pedal until your
brakes are working again.
If you come to a flooded roadway, turn
around and find another way to go. Do
not attempt to drive through the
water! It is impossible to determine the
depth or current and your vehicle could
become submerged or swept away.
Animals
There may be times when an animal
suddenly runs in front of your vehicle.
Do not swerve into oncoming trafic
or of the roadway to avoid hitting the
animal. This may result in a more serious crash than if your vehicle collided
with the animal.
To reduce your chances of colliding
with an animal:
► Use caution when driving at dawn
and dusk; this is when animals are
most active.
► Be extra alert when driving on
roadways marked with animal
crossing signs and near woods
and water.
► Scan the sides of the road and
watch for the reflection of your
headlights in the eyes of animals.
► Deer/vehicle crashes occur most
ofen from October to December.
► Slow down when approaching
animals that are standing near the
roadway, they may bolt out or
change direction.
..................................................................................... SPECIAL DRIVING SITUATIONS
► Flash your headlights to warn other
drivers when animals are spotted
on or near the road.
► If you have time to avoid hitting an
animal, reduce your speed, tap
your brakes, and sound your horn.
Deer tend to fixate on headlights
so flashing them may cause the
animal to freeze. If there are no
vehicles close behind you, brake
hard without locking your wheels.
► If collision is inevitable, do not
swerve to avoid the animal. Keep
your vehicle under control and on
the roadway.
► Report the crash to the law
enforcement if it involves a large
animal such as a bear, deer, or
farm animal.
Following Law
Enforcement Instructions
If you are stopped by a law enforcement oficer:
1. Safely pull of the roadway
immediately to the extreme
right, and clear of trafic.
2. At night, reduce your headlights
to parking lights and turn on
your interior light.
3. Stay in the driver’s seat. Do not
get out of the vehicle unless
asked to do so. Keep your hands
visible. Sit calmly and follow the
oficer’s instructions.
4. Be prepared to show your driver
license, vehicle registration, and
proof of insurance when asked.
If a law enforcement officer is
directing traffic where there is a
traffic signal, obey the officer not
the signal.
The Oficial Florida Driver License Handbook—rev. 06/2022 49
When stopped by a law enforcement
oficer, it’s the law to provide:
► Your driver license,
► Proof of vehicle registration, and
► Proof of insurance

II HANDLING EMERGENCIES
Defensive Driving
Defensive driving is using safe driving strategies to prevent crashes. This
means that you alter your driving to fit the weather conditions, the way you
feel, and the actions of other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Follow
these steps to avoid crashes:
1. Look for possible danger. For example, if you see school zone signs,
plan what you will do if a child runs or rides into the street.
2. Anticipate what another driver might do and make appropriate adjustments. For example, you’ve noticed someone aggressively passing and
changing lanes as they approach you from the rear. You should anticipate
that they will probably pass you and cut you of—slow down and be ready
to brake, if necessary.
3. Crashes happen at intersections more than any other place. Use extra
caution when approaching an intersection.
4. If a crash is unavoidable:
► It is better to swerve of the road than into oncoming trafic.
► It is better to drive of the road than to skid of.
► It is better to hit something that is not moving instead of a vehicle
moving toward you.
► Hitting a vehicle moving in the same direction as you is better than
hitting a vehicle head-on.
► Hitting a “sof object” (e.g., a garden hedge) is better than hitting a
solid object like a tree or post.
Avoiding Rear-End Collisions
To avoid striking the vehicle in front of you, keep at least four seconds following distance and increase following distance during unfavorable weather or
heavy trafic. To lower the risk of someone running into the rear of your vehicle:
► Check your brake lights to make sure they’re clean and working properly.
► Know what is going on around you. Use the rear-view and side mirrors.
► Signal well in advance for turns, stops, and lane changes.
► Avoid sudden stops; slow down gradually and smoothly.
► Drive with the flow of trafic (within the speed limit). Driving too slowly can
be dangerous.
Vehicle Approaching in Your Lane
1. Sound horn and flash high beams.
2. Brake hard.
3. Steer to the side of the road.
The Oficial Florida Driver License Handbook—rev. 06/2022 51
52 ©2022 Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
																																																																																																																																
Breakdowns/Disabled
Vehicles
1. You must move the vehicle so
all four wheels are out of trafic
lanes as soon as possible. If you
can’t move it, you must have it
moved as soon as possible.
2. If possible, park where the
disabled vehicle can be seen
for 200 feet in each direction.
3. Turn on your hazard lights.
4. Get all passengers out of the car
on the side away from trafic.
5. Call *FHP (*347) or law enforcement for assistance.
Right Wheels Of Pavement
1. Take your foot of the gas pedal.
2. Hold the wheel firmly and steer in
a straight line.
3. Brake lightly.
4. Wait until the road is clear. Turn
back on the pavement at a slow
speed (signal your intention).
Skidding/Hydroplaning
1. Take your foot of the gas pedal.
2. Do not use your brakes, if possible.
3. Turn the vehicle’s front tires in the
direction you want to go (steer in
the direction of the skid).
4. If you are about to hit something,
see Emergency Braking, to the right.
Tire Blowout
1. Take your foot off the gas. Do not
use the brakes.
2. Concentrate on steering.
3. Slow down gradually.
4. Brake softly when the car is under
control.
5. Pull completely off the pavement/
roadway.
In Florida, teen drivers were
involved in 46,747 crashes
resulting in 333 fatalities and
1,780 serious injuires in 2020.
(Source: FLHSMV)
Overcorrection
Overcorrection is excessive steering in
reaction to an event or loss of control
of a vehicle. It typically occurs when a
motorist steers too sharply in an efort
to avoid a collision or driving of of the
roadway. It can result in a rollover crash
or steering into oncoming trafic. Avoid
overcorrecting! If you find yourself
unintentionally leaving the roadway:
1. Stay calm.
2. Hold the wheel firmly.
3. Take your foot of the gas and do
not slam on the brakes.
4. Steer the car where desired.
5. If necessary, steer the car to a safe
place and stop.
Emergency Braking
To stop in an emergency situation
where traction is lost, drivers with
conventional brakes should pump the
brakes. Drivers with anti-lock brakes
(ABS) must press down hard on the
brake pedal, hold it, and steer out
of danger. If the motorist with ABS
removes steady pressure from the
brake pedal or pumps the brakes,
the ABS will disengage or turn of.
Vehicles can be equipped with two
diferent types of ABS:
► Four-wheel (on passenger cars
and some light trucks). Brake hard,
steer, and keep constant pressure
on the brake pedal.
REPORT PROBLEM
OR EMERGENCY
1-800-232-0144
X-ING 140729P
............................................................................................ HANDLING EMERGENCIES
► Rear-wheel (only on some light
trucks). ABS prevents the rear
wheels from locking up so that
the back end of the vehicle does
not skid. The front wheels can still
lock up and cause the driver to lose
steering control. If this happens, let
up on the brake pedal just enough
to allow the front wheels to start
rolling again to regain control.
Wet Brakes
1. Test brakes lightly.
2. Brakes may pull to one side or may
not hold at all.
3. Dry brakes by driving slowly in low
gear and applying brakes.
Jammed Gas Pedal
1. Take your foot of the gas pedal.
2. Press the clutch (manual transmission) or shif into neutral (automatic
transmission).
3. If necessary, press—don’t slam—
brakes to slow the vehicle.*
4. Carefully steer to a safe place
to stop.
* Do not shut off engine unless #1 and #2 do not
work to slow the vehicle. If you shut off your
engine, you will lose the ability to steer
the car.
Fire
1. Exit the vehicle.
2. Call 911 for assistance.
3. Attempt to extinguish the fire only
if you have a portable extinguisher
and the fire is small. NEVER apply
water to a gasoline or diesel fire.
4. If you can’t extinguish the fire, get
away from the vehicle! The fumes
are toxic and an explosion is
possible.
Stalled on Railroad Tracks
If your car stalls on the railroad tracks,
get everyone out immediately and
get away from the car!
If you are stalled at a railroad crossing
and the warning lights begin to flash,
20 seconds is the minimal amount of
time that it takes a train to reach the
grade afer the warning lights begin
flashing.
If a train is coming, run in a 45-degree
angle away from the tracks, but in a
direction toward the train; you will be
less likely to be hit by your vehicle or
debris from the collision. Call 911 or
*FHP (*347).
Emergency Notification
System (ENS)
There is a blue ENS sign installed
at every highway-rail grade crossing.
This sign provides critical emergency
contact information to reach the railroad responsible if there is a problem
at the crossing or if something is blocking the tracks.
The Oficial Florida Driver License Handbook—rev. 06/2022 53
54 ©2022 Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
																																																																																																																																
Submerged Vehicle
If you crash into a pond, river, or other
body of water, your vehicle will only
float on the surface for 30–60 seconds.
Get out of the vehicle immediately—
do NOT call 911 until you are completely
out of the vehicle!
1. Unbuckle your safety belt.
2. Roll the window down before the
car sinks. If you are able to open
the door, be aware that the car
will immediately fill with water.
3. If you are unable to roll the
window down, try to kick out a
side window.
There are many types of “escape tools”
available that will quickly break a
window. If you keep one of these in
your vehicle, be sure it is within reach
in case of an emergency.
Power Outage
In circumstances where the power is
out and trafic signals are not active,
treat intersections as a four-way stop:
► Vehicles move through the intersection in the order they arrived
(first to arrive is first to move
forward).
► If multiple vehicles arrive at the
same time, the driver on the lef
yields to the driver on the right.
Your Responsibilities
Afer a Crash
If you are involved in a crash that
results in death, injury or property
damage, it is your duty—required by
law—to give information and render
aid. Always remain calm.
1. Stop and call 911, *FHP (*347),
or local law enforcement.
2. Turn on hazard lights.
3. If anyone is hurt, you must get
help immediately!
4. If the crash is minor and your
vehicle is blocking the flow of
trafic, you must move it or have
it moved.
5. Exchange vehicle, witness,
and driver information (name,
address, phone number, license
plate number, driver license
and insurance).
6. Take photos or sketch the scene,
showing vehicle crash locations.
A law enforcement oficer will complete a written report if the crash
involves a charge of DUI or results in
death, injury, or property damage to
the extent a vehicle must be towed.
If the crash results in vehicle or property damage and does not require a
law enforcement report, you must
make a written report of the crash to
FLHSMV within 10 days. (This can be
done at flhsmv.gov.)
If you are in a crash with an unattended
vehicle or other property, you must
make every attempt to locate the
owner and notify law enforcement.
If you can’t locate the property owner,
you must leave a note including your
name, contact information, and license
plate (registration) number.
@ STAY THE SCENE
............................................................................................ HANDLING EMERGENCIES
Leaving the Scene
It is against the law to leave the scene
of a crash involving death, injury or
property damage.
Hit & Run Penalties
Leaving the scene resulting in:
Death 1st degree felony,
minimum 4-year
prison term.
Serious bodily
injury
2nd degree felony.
Injury 3rd degree felony.
All of the above include losing driver license

First Aid
If you come upon a crash, call 911
or *FHP (*347) and/or send someone
for help. Don’t assume someone else
has called; it’s better for emergency
services to get multiple calls rather
than none at all.
Do not put yourself in danger! Pull as
far of the road as possible and turn
your hazard lights on to alert others.
Be careful when exiting your vehicle
and stay out of trafic.
If someone is injured, apply first aid.
However, don’t move an injured person who may have a neck or spinal
injury. Don’t attempt to remove the
helmet of an injured motorcycle or
bicycle rider.
Treat For Shock
Persons who have been injured may
go into shock. When someone is in
shock, all of the body functions slow
down. Shock can be very serious and
can cause death. Treat the injured for
shock regardless of whether or not
they appear to be in shock:
► Keep the injured person calm.
► Don’t give them anything to drink.
► Have the person lie flat and elevate
their legs.
► Cover the person with blankets to
hold body heat.
► Maintain an open airway.

B YOUR DRIVING PRIVILEGE
Driving in Florida is a privilege you earn. In addition to the rules of the road, you
must also abide by the following laws in order to maintain your driving privilege.
Insurance Laws
Florida law requires drivers and vehicle owners to maintain insurance to cover
costs in case of a crash. These laws include the No-Fault Law and Financial
Responsibility Law.
No-Fault Law
Before you register your car in Florida, you must show proof of Personal Injury
Protection (PIP) and Property Damage Liability (PDL) coverage. PIP covers
your injuries if you’re in a crash, no matter who caused it. PDL coverage pays for
damage to other people’s property that you caused.
Every owner or person in charge of operating a motor vehicle on Florida roadways
must:
► provide proof of valid PIP and PDL insurance at the time of vehicle registration;
► have a minimum of $10,000 in PIP AND a minimum of $10,000 in PDL
coverage;
► purchase the policy from an insurance agency licensed to do business in
Florida;
► maintain the insurance continuously throughout the registration period; and
► always have proof of valid Florida insurance readily available when the vehicle
is being driven on Florida roadways.
You must comply if you own a motor vehicle that has been in the state for 90
days (consecutive or non-consecutive) during the last 365 days. You must maintain proper insurance or your driver license/license plate registration can be
suspended.
Your insurance company is required by law to notify the FLHSMV when you renew
your policy, if you fail to renew it when due, or if the policy is canceled either by
you or the insurance company. If you don’t renew your coverage or it is canceled,
FLHSMV will send you a notice that you must provide proof of new coverage. If
you fail to provide proof of new insurance, your driver license and license plate
can be suspended for up to three years.
If you don’t maintain insurance coverage throughout the vehicle registration
period, you must turn in the vehicle license plate to any driver license service center. Turn in your plate BEFORE canceling your insurance to prevent the
suspension of your license and to avoid reinstatement fees.
Always carry proof of insurance when you or someone else is driving your vehicle.
The Oficial Florida Driver License Handbook—rev. 06/2022 57
58 ©2022 Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
																																																																																																																																
Your insurance company will provide
you with a Florida Insurance
ID Card. You must have the card (or
electronic proof on a smart phone)
with you when you’re driving. You may
receive a citation if you are stopped
by a law enforcement oficer and don’t
have proof of insurance with you. You’ll
have to go to court to prove that you
had insurance coverage at the time you
were stopped, or your driver license
may be suspended. If you don’t have
proof and the judge convicts you, your
driver license and license plate will be
suspended. In order to lif the suspension, you will have to get insurance and
pay a reinstatement fee ($150 to $500).
If your driver license and license plate
have been under suspension for 30 days
or more, a law enforcement oficer can
seize your license plate immediately.
The oficer may also take you to jail
for driving with a suspended license,
which is a first-degree misdemeanor
punishable by up to a year in jail and
a $1,000 fine.
If your driver license or license plate
is suspended for not having insurance,
you won’t be able to get a temporary
license for any reason, not even to go
to work. Also, if you show a law enforcement oficer an insurance card when
you know the insurance has been canceled—or if you falsify the card—you
may be arrested and charged with a
second-degree misdemeanor.
FLHSMV will always provide you with
an opportunity to prove insurance
coverage or have an administrative
hearing. When you receive the notice
of suspension of your license you may
request a hearing; otherwise, one will
not be scheduled for you.
Financial Responsibility Law
In addition to the required PIP and PDL
coverage, if you’re in a crash, you will
have to prove that you are financially
responsible for all damages you caused.
You can prove such financial responsibility by having insurance in efect from
a company licensed to do business
in Florida, or obtaining a Financial
Responsibility Certificate from FLHSMV.
Get more information about Financial
Responsibility Certificates at flhsmv.gov.
Depending on your driving record,
you may have to obtain additional
insurance beyond the basic PIP and
PDL requirements. For example, Florida
law requires you to have Bodily Injury
Liability (BIL) insurance—and increased
PDL coverage—when you are convicted
of Driving Under the Influence (DUI).
The coverage required in such a case
must be at least $100,000 BIL for injuries to one person, $300,000 BIL
for injuries to two or more people,
and $50,000 PDL. This higher coverage must be in efect for three years
afer your DUI conviction. The higher
limits will no longer apply if you are not
convicted of another DUI or any felony
trafic ofense during that three-year
period.
Other higher coverage limits are
required by law if: your driver license
is suspended for accumulation of
excessive points for infractions; you
cause a crash and people were injured;
your driver license was revoked for
Habitual Traffic Offender status; or
your driver license was revoked for
any serious ofense. The required
coverage for these cases are $10,000
BIL for injuries to one person, $20,000
BIL for injuries to two or more people,
.............................................................................................YOUR DRIVING PRIVILEGE
$10,000 PDL; OR $30,000 combined
single limits.
If you do not provide proof of higher
coverage limits, your driver license and/
or license plates will be suspended for
up to three years.
In addition, if you are the driver or the
owner of a vehicle involved in a crash
that is your fault, FLHSMV can require
you to pay for the damages before your
driving privilege is reinstated.
Vehicle Registration
The vehicle you own must have a
Florida registration certificate and
license plate. If a non-resident accepts
employment or engages in a trade,
profession or occupation in Florida;
or enrolls children to be educated in a
Florida public school, they must obtain
the registration certificate and license
plate within 10 days afer beginning
employment or enrollment. You also
must have a Florida Certificate of Title
for your vehicle unless an out-of-state
lien holder/lessor holds the title and
will not release it to Florida.
To get your registration certificate and
license plate, you must show proof
of Florida insurance (in most cases,
you need a Florida driver license to
get insurance.) You must also prove
that you own your vehicle by showing
your certificate of title. The vehicle
identification number (VIN) on any
vehicle previously titled or registered
in another state must be verified by
one of several designated oficials
before the vehicle can be titled and
registered in Florida. VIN verification
is not required on any new vehicles
(regardless of whether purchased in
Florida or out of state), or new/used
mobile homes, trailer type recreational vehicles (travel trailers, camp
trailers, truck campers, and fifh wheel
recreational trailers), or trailers and
semi-trailers with a weight of less than
2,000 pounds.
Applying for Title, License
Plates & Registration
Apply for title, license plates, and
registration at any service center in
Florida. The cost of your license plate
will depend on the type and weight of
your vehicle. Your vehicle must always
have a current license plate and you
must always have your vehicle’s registration when you are driving. If you
buy a vehicle from a dealer in Florida,
the dealer must apply for a certificate
of title, certificate of registration and
license plate for you. If you buy a vehicle from an individual, you must obtain
the title from the individual and apply
for a certificate of title in your name.
You may apply for a certificate of title,
certificate of registration, and license
plate at the same time. You cannot get
a license plate until you have a title
to prove that you own the vehicle. All
first time driver license applicants who
hold an out-of-state license should
apply for a Florida driver license before
they register their vehicle in Florida
(many service centers will do both at
the same time).
Renewal
Vehicle license plates and registrations
must be renewed each year or biennially, on or before the birthday of the
first owner listed on the registration
form. Registrations may be renewed
up to 90 days prior to the expiration
date. Each time you renew, you must
The Oficial Florida Driver License Handbook—rev. 06/2022 59
60 ©2022 Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
																																																																																																																																
prove that you have the required
insurance, unless it’s on file and electronically updated. Registrations
expire at midnight on the birthday
of the first owner listed on the registration form, except for:
► mobile homes renew yearly by
December 31.
► semi-trucks and semi-trailers
renew yearly by December 31.
► vehicles owned by companies and
corporations and some CMVs
renew yearly by June 30.
Violations of the Driver
License Law
You can be put in jail or required to pay
a fine for the following ofenses:
► Altering your license in any way.
► Unlawful use of your license.
► Allowing your license to be used
by another person.
► Making a fraudulent application
for a driver license or ID card.
► Having more than one credential
(US driver license or ID card).
► Allowing an unlicensed person
to use your car, or renting a motor
vehicle to someone without a license.
► Giving false statements to law
enforcement or in a courtroom.
► Knowingly giving false information
in crash reports.
Time Restrictions for Minors
(Driving Curfews)
► Minors holding a learner’s license
must be accompanied by a licensed
driver who is age 21 or older, and
must only drive during daylight

not drive between 1 am and 5 am,
unless driving to or from work or

Littering
It is a crime to dump litter from a
motor vehicle in any amount on any
highway, road, street, etc. If you
throw litter up to 15 pounds onto
roadways, you can be fined $100. You
can be charged with a first-degree
misdemeanor, fined up to $1,000, and
receive 3 points on your driving record,
if dumping more than 15 pounds of
litter. The court may also require you
to pick up litter along roadways.
Use ashtrays for cigarettes and litter
bags for trash while riding in motor
vehicles. Cigarettes that are tossed out
of windows can lead to fires.
Road Damage
It is against the law to damage the
roads by driving on the rim of a flat tire
or by any other means.
.............................................................................................YOUR DRIVING PRIVILEGE
Driving Under the
Influence (DUI)
You can be charged with Driving Under
the Influence (DUI) if you are found to
be driving or in physical control of a
motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic beverages, controlled
substances, prescriptions, or over-thecounter medications.
At the time of arrest, your license will
be administratively suspended if you
have a breath or blood alcohol level
(BAL) of .08 or above, or refuse to submit to a breath/blood alcohol test.
Implied Consent Law
You will be asked to take a blood test,
a urine test, or a breath test if a law
enforcement oficer has reasonable
cause to believe that you are under
the influence of alcohol or drugs while
driving. By law, you have agreed by
signing your driver license to take
these tests if asked.
If you refuse to take the tests when
asked, your license will automatically be suspended for one year.
A second refusal will result in an 18
month suspension and a first degree
misdemeanor.
In DUI cases involving death or serious
injury, you will be required to take a
blood test without your consent. The
blood must be drawn by a doctor, nurse,
or other health professional. Blood may
be drawn if you are unconscious.

Florida law states that if you are
convicted of possessing, selling,
or traficking in drugs, including
marijuana, your driver license
must be revoked.
Additionally, if drugs are in your
vehicle because you are using your
car to transport, sell, or distribute
drugs, or to assist in committing
any other felony, then your car
may be seized and forfeited to the
arresting agency as contraband.
Trafic Crashes
If you are charged in a crash, you may
have to go to court. The law enforcement oficer who comes to the scene of
the crash will file charges against any
driver who violated a trafic law. Those
charged will have a chance to be heard
in court. The court will then decide the
penalty. Others who were present at
the crash may have to come to court as
a witness.
If you are found at fault in a crash where
anyone was injured and transported to
a medical treatment facility, or it is your
second collision in a two-year period,
you will be required by law to attend a
Trafic Collision Avoidance Course.
Three Crashes in Three
Years Law
If you were convicted of, or pleaded
nolo contendre (no contest) to your
third trafic ofense that caused a
crash within 36 months, you must

Advanced Driver Improvement
(ADI) course;
► receive 4 hours of behind-thewheel training from a Florida

with a driver license examiner.
Failure to complete these requirements within 90 days will result in a
license cancellation.

There are a number of infractions
that can cause the loss or restriction
of your driving privileges. You receive
points for moving violations. If you
accumulate too many points in a certain period of time, your license will be
suspended and can be revoked.

Administrative Hearings
If your driving privilege is suspended or revoked, you may be eligible to apply for
a hardship license or reinstatement. For eligibility information, contact the local
Bureau of Administrative Reviews (BAR) ofice, driver license service center, or the
FLHSMV Customer Service Center. To schedule an administrative hearing go to
MyDMVPortal.flhsmv.gov.
If you are administratively suspended for a breath or blood alcohol level of .08 or
above, or refuse to submit to a breath, urine, or blood test and wish to appeal this
suspension, you must apply for a formal or informal review hearing at the appropriate BAR ofice within 10 days of your date of arrest.
A first time DUI ofender who has never had prior DUI related ofenses, may be
eligible to request a review of eligibility for a restricted driver license. By accepting a restricted driver license, the driver agrees to waive the right to a review of
the suspension. To elect this option, the driver must appear at a BAR ofice within
10 days of the DUI arrest, and request the waiver review option and pay a non-refundable fee.
Disabled Parking Permit
If you have a mobility impairment, you don’t have to pay parking fees on any public street, highway, or metered space and may park in spaces reserved for persons
with disabilities. However, you must display a disabled parking permit or plate
to park in these designated spaces and the vehicle must actually be transporting
the person with the disability who owns the permit or registration. Anyone who
obtains or uses a permit that does not belong to them can be charged with a second degree misdemeanor, punishable by a $500 fine or up to 6 months in jail, and
the illegally parked vehicle can be towed and the permit confiscated.

driver improvement course in lieu of
points on your driving record. (You may
not elect to attend if you were charged
with exceeding the speed limit by more
than 30 MPH.)
An individual who elects to attend
a basic driver improvement course
for a non-criminal trafic citation will
receive an 18 percent reduction toward
the civil penalty.
*An up-to-date list of APPROVED course providers can
be found on our website: www.flhsmv.gov
The Oficial Florida Driver License Handbook—rev. 06/2022 85
In some cases, you may choose to
attend a course to receive insurance
discounts. This discount is solely at the
discretion of your insurance company.
If, as a result of a moving violation, you
elect to attend and complete a basic
driver improvement course, you will
receive the following benefits:
1. Insurance companies cannot
impose an additional premium or
refuse to renew a policy for motor
vehicle insurance solely because
the insured committed a non-criminal trafic infraction, with the
following exceptions: a second
infraction within 18 months; a third
infraction within 36 months; or
exceeding the speed limit by more
than 15 MPH.
2. Points may not be added to your
driver license record if adjudication
of guilt is withheld. You may not
make an election under this
subsection if you have made this
election in the preceding 12
months. A person may make no
more than five elections in a
lifetime. To determine if you are
eligible to make an election to
attend trafic school, check our
website at flhsmv.gov.
Within 30 days from the date you
received the trafic citation and prior
to attending class, you must:
1. Inform the Clerk of Court in the
county where you received the
citation that you want to go to
trafic school, and
2. Pay an election fee to the Clerk
of Court in the county where you
received the citation.
A full list of your options for satisfying your trafic citation is on the back
of the citation. You are required to
choose one of the three options within
30 days of receiving the citation.
Advanced Driver
Improvement Courses
If your Florida driver license was
suspended for points, as a habitual
trafic ofender (non-DUI), or by court
order, you must complete an advanced
driver improvement course in order
to reinstate your driving privileges. If
you hold a Florida driver license and
receive a citation for a moving violation in another state, that state may
withhold adjudication if you complete
a FLHSMV-approved advanced driver
improvement course.
Licensed DUI Programs
You may be required to complete a
licensed DUI program if your license
is administratively suspended for:
unlawful blood or breath alcohol level;
refusal to submit to a breath, blood,
or urine test; or conviction of driving
under the influence or possession of a
controlled substance.
Older Driver Courses
Driving courses specifically for older
adults (65+) can update drivers on
trafic laws and suggest useful ways
to adapt driving habits to accommodate aging. Some courses even qualify
older drivers for a reduction in auto
insurance costs.

schools will have the results entered
into FLHSMV’s test records by their
driver education teacher.
The exam results will be used for
issuance of a learner’s driver license
or driver license. However, the driver
license service center may test any
student again on a random basis
before issuing a driver license.
Third Party Testing
The Class E Knowledge Exam is also
available through third party providers
approved by FLHSMV. Students of all
ages may take the exams with a provider that ofers them in an in-person
setting. (Students under 18 may take
the knowledge exam online.) A list of
approved third party providers can be
found at flhsmv.gov.

proper lane and approach the
light at a speed that will allow you
to stop if the light should change.
When the light turns green, do not
move forward until the other
trafic has cleared the intersection.
► Signal and Turn. Get into the
proper lane and signal your turn
for the last 100 feet. You may use
hand signals or mechanical signals.
► Passing. Always look ahead and
behind to make sure you can pass
safely.

examiner will collect the fee and issue
your driver license.
Vehicle Inspection
You must provide a vehicle (with a valid
license plate and insurance) for the
driving skills test. Your vehicle will be
inspected to determine that it is safe
for a driving test. The driving skills test

DRIVER TIPS
1 After a crash involving a motorcycle, drivers often say, "I didn't see him."
Increased awareness of motorcycles will make you more likely to see them.
Motorcycles are often hidden in blind spots or masked by objects or conditions 2 outside the car (bushes, fences, bridges, the sun, etc.). Take extra time to look
for motorcycles.
3 Always assume a motorcycle is closer than it appears; its speed and
distance is difficult for drivers to judge.
4 Don't expect that a motorcyclist will always be able to maneuver out
of the way.
5 Depending on road conditions, a motorcyclist may take longer to stop.
Always allow more following distance behind a motorcycle.
Motorcyclists often slow down by downshifting or rolling off the
6 throttle, thus not activating the brake light. Allow more following
distance, and at intersections anticipate a motorcyclist may slow
down without visual warning.
When you "Watch for Motorcycles," see more than the motorcycle - see the 7 person under the helmet. He or she could be your friend, neighbor, or relative.
